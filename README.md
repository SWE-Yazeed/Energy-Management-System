With the global focus on sustainability, managing energy consumption has become a priority for both industrial and residential sectors. This project introduces an Energy Management System (EMS) to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and ensure compliance with international standards.

## Project Objectives
1. **Energy consumption analysis:** Providing detailed and comprehensive reports on energy consumption within the organization, including identifying patterns and trends.
2. **Improving efficiency:** Identifying opportunities to improve energy efficiency and reduce waste through optimal control of daily operations.
3. **User management:** Granting permissions to users and system administrators to monitor energy consumption and control settings.
4. **Providing an easy-to-use user interface:** Designing an intuitive user interface for smooth interaction.

## System Features
- Collect and store data.
- Analyze data and generate reports.
- Support decision-making.
- Predict future energy consumption.
- Promote sustainability.

## Importance of the System
- **Cost Savings:** Save 10-30% on energy bills.
- **Improved Efficiency:** 80% of organizations report noticeable improvements after implementation.
- **Environmental Impact:** A 1% reduction in energy consumption leads to a 2.5% decrease in carbon emissions.
- **Building Performance:** Reduce energy usage by up to 20%.
- **Awareness:** Foster collaboration to achieve sustainability goals.
